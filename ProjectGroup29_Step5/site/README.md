<h1>Overview</h1>
	Clearwater Arena is a stadium near multiple small towns in the state of Wisconsin that provide world-class entertainment through their venues. It requires a database to store their ticket sales, artists, fan information, and price per ticket.  It also keeps track of all of the employees at Clearwater Arena. These employees provide different services to fans such as bartenders, customer service reps, cashiers, and security. It maintains a record of which employees and artists are performing at which concert on a specific date. A database driven website will record all of the sales of Tickets for Fans, Artists, and Employees. Lastly, it categorizes each ticket sold for the purpose of managing ticket sales and quality correctly.
